How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all, you need to install the package using pip.

.. code:: bash

	$ pip install soba

In case of error, this other command should be used, ensuring to have installed python 3 and pip 3.

.. code:: bash

	$ pip3 install soba

The folder 'docs' should be ignored.
